# Predict # **AirQo African Air Quality Prediction Challenge**
Air pollution is the world’s largest environmental health risk, contributing to 7 million premature deaths globally each year. Developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, are heavily impacted due to limited resources for air quality monitoring. Ground monitoring stations are sparse and costly to implement and maintain, especially in urban areas where pollution is most severe. This project aims to bridge the gap by leveraging satellite-derived data and machine learning to provide accurate air quality estimates, focusing on PM2.5 concentrations in eight African cities: Lagos, Accra, Nairobi, Yaounde, Bujumbura, Kisumu, Kampala, and Gulu.

Objectives:
Accurate Estimation of PM2.5 Levels:

Utilize satellite observations, specifically Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), along with other atmospheric data, to accurately estimate ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. This involves developing robust machine learning models that can effectively interpret satellite data to predict PM2.5 levels.
Enhancing Public Health and Environmental Protection:

Provide reliable air quality data to support public health initiatives and environmental policies. Accurate PM2.5 estimates are crucial for identifying high-risk areas, informing the public about pollution levels, and implementing effective interventions to mitigate exposure.
Addressing Data Gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa:

Develop a scalable and cost-effective solution to overcome the scarcity of ground monitoring stations in African cities. By harnessing satellite data, we aim to fill the data gaps and provide continuous air quality monitoring across large areas.
Empowering Communities:

Deploy the models through AirQo’s user-friendly digital platform (http://platform.airqo.net), enabling communities to access crucial air quality information. This empowers local populations with the evidence needed to tackle pollution challenges, advocate for cleaner environments, and achieve environmental justice.
Importance of the Project:
This project is critical as it leverages advanced machine learning techniques and satellite data to provide a sustainable and scalable solution to air quality monitoring in resource-constrained environments. Accurate estimation of PM2.5 levels helps protect public health by providing timely and precise data on air pollution, which is essential for creating effective policies and interventions. Furthermore, it addresses the urgent need for comprehensive air quality data in sub-Saharan Africa, where traditional monitoring methods are often infeasible. By empowering communities with reliable air quality information, we can foster a proactive approach to environmental health, ultimately leading to healthier and more resilient populations.
