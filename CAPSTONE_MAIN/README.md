# Predict # **AirQo African Air Quality Prediction Challenge**
Estimating ground-level PM2.5 concentrations in eight African cities using satellite data. Ground monitoring stations are sparse and expensive to maintain, especially in developing countries. By leveraging satellite-derived data and machine learning, you aim to provide accurate air quality estimates, which are essential for public health and environmental protection.
Objective:
accurately estimate PM2.5 levels using satellite observations based on Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and other atmospheric data.
