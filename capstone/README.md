Brain Stroke happens when there is a blockage in the blood circulation in the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain breaks and leaks. The burst or blockage prevents blood and oxygen reaching the brain tissue. Without oxygen the tissues and cells in the brain are damaged and die in no time leading to many symptoms.

Once brain cells die, they generally do not regenerate and devastating damage may occur, sometimes resulting in physical, cognitive and mental disabilities. It is crucial that proper blood flow and oxygen be restored to the brain as soon as possible.

Worldwide, brain stroke is the second leading cause of death and third leading cause of disability. In some cases, the warning signs of a stroke can be obvious but what’s going on inside the body is incredibly complex. 80% of strokes are preventable. But once you’ve had a stroke, the chances you have another one are greater.

using the stroke datset from kaggle were are going to perform exploratory data analysis EDA and come with the best model to predict the patient's risk of stroke.
